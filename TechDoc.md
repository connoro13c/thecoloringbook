Responsive Design: Fully responsive across desktop, tablet, mobile

4. Backend & APIs

Serverless Functions: Next.js API Routes on Vercel

AI Integration:

GPT-4o (Vision) for image analysis

DALL·E 3 for AI-generated coloring pages

Moderation: GPT-4o-based automated content moderation to prevent inappropriate or unsafe uploads/descriptions

5. File Storage & Management

Supabase Storage:

Temporary storage for anonymous users (only processing)

Permanent secure storage for authenticated users

Output Formats: JPG and PDF directly from AI output without additional libraries

6. Payment Processing

Stripe Integration:

Payments processed securely via Stripe

Charges:

Initial image download: $0.99

Regeneration (minor adjustments): $0.50

Transaction Notifications:

Email confirmation for users via SendGrid

Slack webhook integration for real-time transaction updates

7. Authentication & Authorization

Provider: Supabase Auth

User Roles:
